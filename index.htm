    <h1>Welcome to <strong>Programming: it's a girl thing!</strong></h1>
    <h2>Why this website?</h2>
	<p> After graduating with a BA in Political Science and a Masters Degree in International Law I found myself looking for a job for 6 months. The position that I found was as a game tester and German localizer.</p>
	<p> This was my first introduction to the IT world. Because I was curious how some things work, I started with codeacademy, went to some events and decided to go to school for an AA in programming.</p>
	<p> This website is meant to be a resource for girls and women.<p>

  <p>If you want to change the world and help communities develop, invent new things that make a difference in people's lives, this is the field to be in.Programming offers such a rewarding career: you can use your imagination, creativity, humour, problem solving skills to have an impact in people's lives.</p>

  <div class="lady_banner">
    <a href="OanaP-ForLadies.htm" title="ladies only" class="forladies"><h1>Coding for ladies</h1></a>
    <p>I never imagined that I would change my career but here I am. It is a scary process, but a rewarding one. You can bring with you all your background, adapt it and give everything a new meaning. Programming is about empowerment, learning new skills and changing the world. Go for it!</p>
